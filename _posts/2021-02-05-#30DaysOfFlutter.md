This post is targeted at software developers, who are always interested in learning new technologies.
 
Beginning of this year, I took it upon myself to learn other programming languages and frameworks outside of my Python comfort zone. As a data scientist by training, I thought other programming languages were of not much use to me. Well, that was true to some extent. Python allowed me to analyze data, build machine learning models and even build web apps (Django. I'll write a separate post on that).
 
This year, I felt like I needed to scratch my own itch of creating something users could interact with. I've always been fascinated by the idea of creating value for people. Maybe mobile development might allow me to launch such a thing. The question was, where do I start?
 
# Meet Flutter
Flutter is an amazing open source framework by Google, built on top of a programming language called Dart. For those who have worked on front end software projects, Flutter is similar to React. It allows you to build applications for Android , iOS and for the web. ALL IN JUST ONE CODE BASE. I know, it's quite cool. You only have to write code once and it magically works everywhere.
 
The syntax of Dart is quite similar to JavaScript so I found the learning curve to be not too steep. Google really put in the effort of making the transition easy for developers I must say.
 
So basically, you build the user interface as code (as opposed to drag and drop). Everything in Flutter is a Widget. From the Screen, Text, to buttons and App Bars.
 
Under the hood, the engine uses C/C++ code. I'm assuming this is why the performance of these apps is quite fast. I can't say much on specs, as I'm only a couple of weeks in at this point.
 
# Code Along
It would be really amazing if you joined the #30DaysOfFlutter challenge to give Flutter a try. Even if you have no prior programming experience, there is a lot of material to get you started and the community is quite welcoming.
 
Take care. See you on the other side. :)
